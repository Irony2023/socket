# Python Socket Programming

A sample socket programming in python using low level networking interface *socket*. You will find follwing on top of vanilla implementation you find in any first tutorial link you get from googling:
* Multithreading to handle multiple client
* Use of pickel to serialize any type of data 
* Handling of variable length data by passing data size along with payload
* Passing data type with payload as additional information to take specific action accordingly (eg. if data type is image then save it)
* Using keyboard interrupt to close client and server cleanly
* Specifying the list of trusted client so that no untrusted client could be connected

Note: While writing this program python 3.7.4 was used

Feel free to request more feature you would like, i wil try to add it when i get time
