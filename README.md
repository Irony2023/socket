# Python Socket Programming
Socket programming in python. You will find follwing on top of vanilla implementation you find in any first tutorial link you get from googling:
* Multithreading to handle multiple client
* Use of pickel to serialize any type of data 
* Handling of variable length data by passing data size along with payload
* Passing data type with payload as additional information to take specific action accordingly (eg. if data type is image then save it)
* Using keyboard interrupt to close client and server cleanly
* Specifng list of trusted client so that no untrusted client could be connected
